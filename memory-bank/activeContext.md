# Active Context

## Recent Changes
1. **IRQ Implementation (2025-03-06)**
   - Added interrupt-based card detection
   - Configured IRQ pin on RC522
   - Removed polling-based detection

2. **Audio Feedback (2025-03-06)**
   - Added buzzer support on pin 3
   - Implemented feedback patterns:
     * Authorized: 2kHz for 1 second
     * Unauthorized: 400Hz, 3x 200ms beeps
     * Error: 100Hz for 500ms

3. **LED Behavior Update (2025-03-06)**
   - Modified green LED behavior for authorized cards
     * Now stays on for 1 full second
   - Modified red LED behavior for unauthorized cards
     * Now blinks 3 times (200ms on/off)

## Current State
1. **Active Features**
   - Interrupt-driven card detection
   - Battery voltage monitoring
   - Wireless data transmission
   - Visual and audio feedback
   - Power management

2. **System Health**
   - RC522 operating in interrupt mode
   - SPI bus sharing working correctly
   - Power management active
   - Error recovery mechanisms in place

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**
   - Verify interrupt reliability
   - Test power consumption in new mode
   - Validate audio feedback patterns
   - Check LED timing accuracy

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Fine-tune buzzer frequencies
   - Optimize timing parameters
   - Consider adding configurable card list
   - Evaluate battery life with new features

## Active Decisions
1. **Power Management**
   - Maintaining sleep mode during idle
   - Using interrupt for efficient wake-up
   - Keeping power optimization as priority

2. **User Interface**
   - Synchronized audio and visual feedback
   - Clear distinction between states
   - Immediate response to card detection

3. **Error Handling**
   - Maintained robust error recovery
   - Added audio feedback for errors
   - Visual indicators for system state

## Current Focus
- Ensuring reliability of interrupt-based detection
- Monitoring power consumption with new features
- Validating user feedback mechanisms
- Maintaining system stability

## Known Considerations
1. **Hardware**
   - IRQ pin requires pull-up resistor
   - Buzzer volume depends on power supply
   - LED brightness affects power consumption

2. **Software**
   - Interrupt handling is time-critical
   - Audio generation timing affects system responsiveness
   - Sleep mode must not interfere with IRQ detection

3. **Integration**
   - Gateway communication maintained
   - Card data structure unchanged
   - Protocol compatibility preserved
