# RFID Reader Project Rules

## Project Patterns
1. All hardware pins are defined at the top using #define
2. LED and buzzer feedback functions are grouped together
3. SPI device selection is managed through dedicated configuration functions
4. Error handling includes both visual and audio feedback
5. Power optimization is a primary consideration in all changes

## Code Style
1. Functions use camelCase naming
2. Constants use UPPER_CASE
3. Pin definitions use Snake_Case (e.g., RST_PIN)
4. Clear function separation for different responsibilities
5. Consistent error handling patterns

## Documentation Requirements
1. All timing values must be clearly documented
2. Power management changes require careful consideration
3. Hardware pin changes must be updated in all documentation
4. Changes to feedback patterns must maintain clear user distinction

## Testing Patterns
1. Hardware changes require power consumption validation
2. Timing changes need real-world testing
3. Error conditions must be explicitly tested
4. User feedback requires physical verification

## Change Management
1. Power-related changes require extra scrutiny
2. SPI bus changes need careful timing verification
3. Interrupt-related changes must preserve reliability
4. User feedback changes must maintain clarity

## Implementation Preferences
1. Prefer interrupt-based detection over polling
2. Use clear timing constants for feedback patterns
3. Implement robust error recovery
4. Maintain consistent user feedback patterns

## Known Project Quirks
1. RC522 requires specific timing for initialization
2. NRF24L01 needs power stabilization delays
3. SPI bus sharing requires careful state management
4. Interrupt handling is timing-sensitive
